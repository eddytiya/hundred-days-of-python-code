#object oriented programming
'''till now we have used procedure programming '''
#eg
def hello():
    print("helo adis")

hello()    

#eg:suppose u have to coumt sales of 2 persons or companies

sales1=6000
profit1=2000
ad1=1000
#aditya.sales

sales2=6000
profit2=2000
ad2=1000
#vik.sales

sales3=6000
profit3=2000
ad3=1000
#harold.sales

'''

we use oop to create a class or object ot store data in one place rether than keepinf track of each
